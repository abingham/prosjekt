 prosjekt
==========

*project workspaces for emacs*

A project in this sense is:
  
  * A set of files that you wish to operate with, and
  * A set of commands bound to key shorcuts and menu entries

In particular prosjekt lets you switch between projects as easily as
between files.

Keys
====

Global:

 * F5        : Toggle project setup
 * Ctrl-F5   : Browse project directory in dired
 * Alt-Left  : Previous file
 * Alt-Right : Next file

In the project setup:

 * Arrow keys   : Navigate
 * Return       : Open project, file, tool
 * <letter>     : Quick search
 * Alt-<letter> : Activate link
 * Spacebar     : Enter edit mode
 * Escape       : Quit edit mode

In dired:

 * a : Add file(s) to the project

Setup
=====

Projects
--------

This is the global project list. You can open and close projects, and
add new or already existing ones to the list.

Files
-----

Files are added to the project simply when they are first visited.
Similar they are removed then they get killed.  New files are inserted
after the one that was last viewed.

Tools
-----

Here you can enter some shell command lines with tools that you wish
to have at hand, and optionally bind them to key shortcuts.  The tools
will show up in the menu also.

There are two options that can be put in front of commands:

  * -e <emacs-command>           run lisp command or sexp
  * -in <directory> <command>    run command in specified directory.

A trailing '&' enables asynchronous execution without redirection.
Relative paths refer to the project directory.

A new project is initialized with default tool commands.

Settings
--------

Currently there is only:

    prosjekt-name - name of the project
    

Edit Mode
---------

In the project setup, hit the the spacebar to enter edit mode.  You
can edit pretty much everything except it has little effect to change
the name of a project other than the current one.

Hit escape to quit the edit mode. Any changes to the configuration are
saved automatically when the project is closed.

Usage
=====

To load prosjekt, add this line to your ~/.emacs::

  (load-file "/path/to/prosjekt.el")

prosjekt will automatically start up with the last recently used
project. It will also restore the frame size and position.  You can
start emacs with a specific project from the command line using::

  emacs -project <projectname>

Configuration
=============

There are some variables at top of prosjekt.el that you might want to
edit.
