;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Adds simple support for dirtree to prosjekt. Specifically, it adds
;; a function, prosjekt-dirtree, for opening a dirtree buffer at the
;; project root.
;; 
;; To activate this function, add dirtree-prosjekt.el to your load
;; path and add
;;
;;   (require 'dirtree-prosjekt)
;;
;; to your emacs config.
