;; Allows opening and closing prosjekt projects through anything, as well as
;; selection of files within a project.
;;
;; To activate, add anything-prosjekt.el to your load path and
;;
;;   (require 'anything-prosjekt)
;;
;; to your .emacs. You can then use the following sources
;;
;;  `anything-c-source-prosjekt-files'
;;    Search for files in the current prosjekt.
;;  `anything-c-source-prosjekt-projects'
;;    Open or close prosjekt projects.
;;
;; like this
